# Team Name Curio
## Working on theme : Audio Dubbing for youtube Videos

## Team Members

- Abhishek Bhardwaj
- Deepanshu Mishra

## How will we solve the problem?
We aim to build a website which will serve as an open platform where people can come and translate their favourite YouTube videos in their respective languages to help bridge the gap of language and communication between learners.


## What will be our final demo?
Our final demo will be a live/recorded demonstration of our website where we will record the translation of a video upload it on a global server and then play it in sync with the desired YouTube video.
